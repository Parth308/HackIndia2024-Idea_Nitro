# 🚀 Blockchain Basics and Our Hackathon Project

## Introduction
Welcome to our hackathon project! Our goal is to provide a practical and comprehensive guide to understanding blockchain technology, including key concepts such as hashing, blocks, blockchain, tokens, and coins. We'll also introduce our hackathon project that demonstrates these concepts in action.

## 🔗 What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This ensures transparency and security.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

### 🔒 Hashing
Hashing is the process of converting an input (or 'message') into a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, typically a 'hash code', is unique to each unique input, ensuring data integrity and security.

### 📦 Blocks
A block is a data structure used for storing a set of transactions. Each block contains:
- **Hash**: A unique identifier for the block.
- **Previous Hash**: The hash of the previous block in the chain.
- **Data**: The actual data or transactions.

### ⛓️ Blockchain
A blockchain is a series of blocks linked together, where each block references the previous one. This chain of blocks ensures the immutability and security of the data stored within.

### 💎 Tokens
Tokens are digital assets created within a blockchain platform. They can represent a variety of assets or utilities and are often used within decentralized applications (dApps).

### 🪙 Coins
Coins are digital currencies created from their own blockchain. Examples include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). They are used as a medium of exchange, store of value, or unit of account.

## 🌟 Our Hackathon Project

### 📝 Project Overview
Our project aims to demonstrate the practical application of blockchain technology. We have created a simple blockchain implementation that includes features such as Hash creation, block creation, and blockchain validation.

### 🚀 Features
- **Hash Creation**: Helps in understanding Hashes.
- **Block Creation**: Creates new blocks containing transaction data.
- **Blockchain Explaination**: Ensures the integrity and security of the blockchain.
- **Token/Coin Integration**: Demonstrates the use of tokens and coins within our blockchain.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **AngularJS**: For frontend logic and blockchain implementation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend design and user interaction.
